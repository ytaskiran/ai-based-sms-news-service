I don't even know the process of creating a project by myself without AI telling me what to do. Please give me advice on how I can make really good projects.

    "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oetrex/d_how_was_multihead_latent_attention_not_a_thing/",
    "published": "2025-10-24T10:06:43",
    "source": "Machine Learning Subreddit",
    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) was introduced by DeepSeek-V2 in 2024. The idea is to project keys and values into a latent space and perform attention there, which drastically reduces complexity.</p> <p>What I don't understand: how did no one propose this earlier? It feels like a pretty natural next step, especially given the trends we\u2019ve seen over the past few years.</p> <p>For instance, the shift from diffusion in pixel space to latent diffusion (e.g. Stable Diffusion) followed that same principle: operate in a learned latent representation (e.g. through some modern VAE variation) for efficiency. And even in the attention world, Perceiver (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03206\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03206</a>) in 2021 already explored projecting queries into a latent space to reduce complexity. MLA feels like a very small step from that idea, yet it didn't appear until 2024.</p> <p>Of course, I know this is a bit of a naive take since in ML research we all know how this goes: in practice, good ideas often don't work out out of the box without &quot;tricks&quot; or nuances. Maybe (probably) someone did try something like MLA years ago, but it just didn't deliver without the right tricks or architecture choices.</p> <p>So I'm wondering: is that what happened here? Did people experiment with latent attention before but fail to make it practical, until DeepSeek figured out the right recipe? Or did we really just overlook latent attention all this time, even with hints like Perceiver already out there as far back as 2021?</p> <p>edit: I'm not claiming it's trivial or that I could've invented it. I'm just curious about why an idea that seems like a natural extension of previous work (like Perceiver or latent diffusion) didn't appear until now. Personal challenges on &quot;why didn't I do it if it's so easy&quot; kinda miss the point. Let's keep the focus to the research discussion :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/howtorewriteaname\"> /u/howtorewriteaname </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oetrex/d_how_was_multihead_latent_attention_not_a_thing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oetrex/d_how_was_multihead_latent_attention_not_a_thing/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I guess back than the compression was not the main focus, in this paper the focus was on 10x compression. And this gave the AI community idea to compress the input context of LLMs by representing it in image and compressing the image in latent space which could be much more dense as compared to text where the structure is constraint by tokens as the lowest compressed form.</p> <p>But can't we just compress the text tokens by training an autoencoder and using the encoder to generate the latent space lower dimensional embeddings.</p> <p><strong>Would love to hear what others think</strong></p> <p><strong>Paper link:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18234\"><strong>https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18234</strong></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Toppnotche\"> /u/Toppnotche </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oedumd/deepseek_ocr_high_compression_focus_but_is_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1oedumd/deepseek_ocr_high_compression_focus_but_is_the/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Continuous normalising flows push a source distribution to a target distribution via a diffeomorphism (usually an automorphism of d-dimensional Euclidean space). I'm confused about sparsely sampled parts of the data distribution and whether the fact that the diffeomorphic mapping is assuming things about the data distribution (e.g. its connectivity) that aren't actually true (is it modelling the distribution too coarsely or is it learning the true distribution?).</p> <p>E.g. let's say the data distribution has a lot of pictures of dogs and a lot of pictures of cats but no pictures of &quot;half dogs-half cats&quot; because they don't actually exist (note that there may be pictures of dogs that looks like cats but would sit in the cat picture part of the distribution -- dogcats do not exist in the real world). But the region in between the peaks of this bimodal distribution should be zero. But when we perform a diffeomorphic mapping from the source p (e.g., a Gaussian) part of the probability mass must be pushed to the intermediate part of the distribution. This is problematic because then we sample our q (by sampling p and pushing through the learned flow) we might end up with a picture of a halfdog-halfcat but that isn't physically possible.</p> <p>What is going wrong here?</p> <ol> <li>Is the assumption that our map is a diffeomorphism too restrictive, e.g., for topologically disconnected data distributions?</li> </ol> <p>OR</p> <ol> <li>Is the model faithfully learning what the intermediate regions of the data distribution look like? That seems magical because we haven't given it any data and in the example I've given it's impossible. Rather the diffeomorphic assumption gives us an intermediate part of the distribution that might be wrong because the true target distribution is topologically disconnected.</li> </ol> <p>It seems of paramount importance that we know a priori about the topological structure of the data distribution -- no?</p> <p>If you know any sources discussing this, that would be very helpful!</p> <p>Many thanks!</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/exchxfoolpwf1.png?width=870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e2f0d950f589cdc81044707e6a3498fefec2c51\">I'm interested in the intermediate region between the peaks</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rcafr6orlpwf1.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=136bfbd3136b90baddd5974823a0f6b00c35a43a\">samples from the source distribution p (e.g. Gaussian) at t=0</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3iyuefvslpwf1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d51c4a7c2da085b4893bfd9927d3b238093a25ea\">mid way through the flow 0&lt;t&lt;1</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5zn4v2ktlpwf1.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d8d5e0887cf0cb1b7ad2f6190b53e633bc7dd25\">The target distibution q at t=1.

Reinforcement learning inside the latent space of a diffusion model is surprisingly efficient compared to traditional RL (as few as 50 rollouts with sparse rewards). </p> <p>This works well, but the primary bottleneck is a lack of large action datasets.

And after this point the test error again start to decrease creating a second descent.</p> <p>To explain its cause:<br /> When model capacity is low you underfit (high bias). As capacity rises toward the <strong>interpolation threshold</strong> (capacity \u2248 training data degrees of freedom) the model can exactly fit the training data, so tiny changes in training data can lead to large fluctuations in the learned parameters and predictions, causing the validation or test error to spike sharply due to high variance.<br /> Before the interpolation point when there is lot more dataset as compared to model complexity, the model learns to ignore the noise and only capture the most relevant patterns as it doesn't have enough parameters.<br /> <strong>Overparameterized region:</strong> with many more parameters than data, there are infinitely many zero-training-error solutions; optimization (and explicit regularizes like weight decay or implicit biases of SGD) tends to select low-complexity/low-norm solutions, so test error can drop again -&gt;<strong>double descent</strong>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Toppnotche\"> /u/Toppnotche </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1odekaj/d_bigger_more_overfitting/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1odekaj/d_bigger_more_overfitting/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It uses PatchTST's patching algorithm to segment time series into overlapping windows.</p> <p>The core insight is that attention works best as a global organizational mechanism, not necessarily something you need implemented in every block.

    "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Quick context: I'm training a playable DOOM world model where you can prompt like &quot;spawn cyberdemon left&quot; or &quot;harder&quot; to change game events in real time. I wanted to take DeepMind's playable Doom world model in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14837\">Diffusion Models are Real-Time Game Engiens</a>, and add text conditioning to make game events promptable.</p> <p><strong>To train this I need ~100 hours of action-labeled DOOM gameplay data.</strong></p> <p>I could have scraped DOOM data from YouTube, or paid contractors, but thought it would be fun to train a curious RL agent that explores the map. I thought this would be a solved problem, since I saw RL papers from 2018 about &quot;curiosity-driven&quot; learning.</p> <p>I couldn't have been more wrong! Training agents to be &quot;curious&quot; is far from a solved problem. Here's what I tried and what happened so far:</p> <p><strong>1. Implemented the original</strong> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05363\"><strong>curiosity-driven exploration</strong></a> <strong>paper(Pathak et al., 2018) \u2192 hit the Noisy TV Problem</strong></p> <p>The Noisy TV Problem is where the agent gets stuck staring at a random process in the game. This is a known problem with defining the curiosity bonus as prediction error, since noise is not learnable. The specific &quot;Noisy TV&quot; the agent converges to is getting transfixed by the pistol's muzzle smoke against a high-contrast white background.</p> <p><strong>2. Implemented</strong> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25438v1\">Learning Progress Monitoring</a> <strong>(2025) \u2192 agent converged to taking no action.</strong></p> <p>The paper defined curiosity bonus as learning progress: difference between past prediction error of next state and current prediction error of next state. Sounds good on paper, but in practice you have to get a lot right to guarantee past prediction error &gt; current prediction error for learnable (non-random) states. I couldn't figure this out, and past and present prediction error became roughly equal during training, causing agent to take no action due to lack of reward.</p> <p><strong>3. Implemented OpenAI</strong> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12894\">Random Network Distillation</a> <strong>\u2192 agent learns but not because of curiosity</strong></p> <p>The agent learned, but only because of extrinsic rewards (kills, room discovery, etc), not curiosity bonus rewards. After many iterations, curiosity bonus rewards shrank to zero as well, similar to LPM. The agent acts greedily to kill enemies and discover rooms, with little to no variety in its actions.</p> <p>More details here in my repo, where all three implementations work out-of-box: <a href=\"https://github.com/pythonlearner1025/BoredDoomGuy\">https://github.com/pythonlearner1025/BoredDoomGuy</a></p> <p>At this point, I reminded myself training a curious RL agent is a side quest, and I have to get back on the main quest. But if you've trained an agent to complete Doom E1M1 purely from curiosity, I'm curious to hear how you did it!</p> <p>For now, I'm falling back to collecting training data from human players. You can help by playing doom in your browser at <a href=\"https://www.playdoom.win\">playdoom.win</a> your fun is my training data: your game viewport and actions will be logged!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/invocation02\"> /u/invocation02 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1od0v4o/p_getting_purely_curiosity_driven_agents_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1od0v4o/p_getting_purely_curiosity_driven_agents_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

However, reasoning capabilities exhibit emergent behavior only at larger scales (typically &gt;7B parameters), making traditional proxy approaches ineffective. rBridge solves this by aligning evaluation with both (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task through weighted negative log-likelihood using frontier model reasoning traces.</p> <p><strong>Key Contributions:</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Theoretical insight:</strong> We identify that proxy evaluation schemes must align with both pre-training objectives and target tasks for effective reasoning prediction</li> <li><strong>Novel method:</strong> rBridge weights NLL by task-alignment using frontier model confidence scores, handling tokenizer mismatches at letter-level</li> <li><strong>Empirical validation:</strong> <ul> <li>100.2\u00d7 compute reduction for dataset ranking (80.8% decision accuracy across 25 datasets)</li> <li>Strong proxy-target correlations: R\u00b2 = 0.826-0.874 across 6 benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH500, ARC-C, MMLU Pro, CQA, HumanEval)</li> <li>Zero-shot transfer of fitted functions across pre-training datasets</li> </ul></li> </ol> <p><strong>Experimental Setup:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Proxy scales: 100M to 1B</li> <li>Target scales: 7B to 32B</li> <li>Training corpus: 250B to 3.75T tokens</li> <li>Evaluation: 5-fold cross-validation</li> </ul> <p><strong>Practical Impact:</strong> This enables compute-constrained researchers to explore pre-training design choices at dramatically reduced costs. A single 7B training run can exceed $50K; our method reduces exploration costs by 100\u00d7+ while maintaining predictive accuracy.</p> <p>Code will be released soon.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jshin49\"> /u/jshin49 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1od0fw8/r_rbridge_predicting_llm_reasoning_performance/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1od0fw8/r_rbridge_predicting_llm_reasoning_performance/\">[comments]</a></span>",
